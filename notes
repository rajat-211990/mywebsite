this project was for a small brand named jasmine agarbatti, that asked for a simple landing page with capability to be changed from backend.

Built a backend using django and front end through template html and css

pip install django 
django-admin startproject 
python manage.py runserver
port 8000

create an app and register it in the settings 
create template folder inside the app itself to separate assets of different project from each other and
one staticfiles folder to point to images videos JS files...it is mentioned as STATIC_URL = '/staticfiles/'
For handling media files and css files..we create staticfiles folder and then we make images folder inside ...MEDIA_URLS is pointed to images folder....
so path from image becomes {% static 'images/rajat.jpg'%}
